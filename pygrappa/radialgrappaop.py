    '''Non-Cartesian Radial GRAPPA operator.

    Parameters
    ----------
    kx, ky: array_like
        k-space coordinates of kspace data, k.  kx and ky are 2D
        arrays containing (sx, nr) : (number of samples along ray,
        number of rays).
    k : array_like
        Complex kspace data corresponding to the measurements at
        locations kx, ky.  k has three dimensions: sx, nr, and coil.
    nspokes : int, optional
        Number of spokes.  Used when (kx, ky) and k are given with
        flattened sample and spoke axes, i.e., (sx*nr, nc).
    spoke_axis : int, optional
        Axis of k that contains the spoke data.  Not for kx, ky: see
        spoke_axis_coord to specify spoke axis for kx and ky.
    coil_axis : int, optional
        Axis of k that contains the coil data.
    spoke_axis_coord : int, optional
        Axis of kx and ky that hold the spoke data.
    lamda : float, optional
        Tikhonov regularization term used both for fitting Gtheta
        and log(Gx), log(Gy).
    ret_lGtheta : bool, optional
        Return log(Gtheta) instead of Gx, Gy.
    traj_warn : bool, optional
        Warn about potential inconsistencies in trajectory, e.g.,
        not shaped correctly.

    Returns
    -------
    Gx, Gy : array_like
        GRAPPA operators along the x and y axes.

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError
        If kx and ky do not have spokes along spoke_axis_coord or if
        the standard deviation of distance between spoke points is
        greater than or equal to 1e-10.

    Notes
    -----
    Implements the radial training scheme for self calibrating GRAPPA
    operators in [1]_.  Too many coils could lead to instability of
    matrix exponents and logarithms -- use PCA or other suitable
    coil combination technique to reduce dimensionality if needed.
