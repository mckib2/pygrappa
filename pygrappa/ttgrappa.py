    """Through-time GRAPPA.

    Parameters
    ----------
    kx, ky: array_like
        k-space coordinates of kspace data, kspace.  kx and ky are 1D
        arrays.
    kspace : array_like
        Complex kspace data corresponding to the measurements at
        locations kx, ky.  kspace has two dimensions: data and coil.
        Unsampled points should be exactly 0.
    cx, cy: array_like
        k-space coordinates of calibration kspace data.  cx and cy
        are 1D arrays.
    calib : array_like
        Complex kspace data corresponding to the measurements at
        locations cx, cy.  calib has three dimensions: data, time,
        and coil.
    kernel_size : int, optional
        Number of points to use as sources for kernel training.  This
        many nearest neighbors to the targets will be chosen.
    kernel_radius : float, optional
        If not None, this radius will be used instead of kernel_size.
        All sources within this radius of the target will be chosen.
        Has units same as kx, ky.
    max_kernel_size : int, optional
        Maximum number of points in ball when using kernel_radius.
        If more sources are found, then randomly choose
        max_kernel_size of them.
    coil_axis : int, optional
        Dimension of kspace and calib holding coil data.
    time_axis : int, optional
        Dimension of calib holding time data.
    lamda : float, optional
        Tikhonov regularization for the kernel calibration.

    Returns
    -------
    res : array_like
        The reconstructed measurements with the same size as kspace.

    Notes
    -----
    Implements the through-time GRAPPA algorithm for non-Cartesian
    reconstruction as described in [1]_.

    This implementation uses a kd-tree for kernel selection similar
    to [2]_.  This simplifies searches for kernel geometries and
    helps make this implementation trajectory agnostic.
