def find_acs(kspace, coil_axis: int=-1):
    """Find the largest centered hyper-rectangle possible.

    Parameters
    ----------
    kspace : array_like
        Measured undersampled complex k-space data. N-1 dimensions
        hold spatial frequency axes (kx, ky, kz, etc.).  1 dimension
        holds coil images (`coil_axis`).  The missing entries should
        have exactly 0.
    coil_axis : int, optional
        Dimension holding coil images.

    Returns
    -------
    calib : array_like
        Fully sampled calibration data extracted from the largest
        possible hypercube with origin at the center of k-space.

    Notes
    -----
    This algorithm is not especially elegant, but works just fine
    with the assumption that the ACS region will be significantly
    smaller than the entirety of the data.  It grows a hyper-
    rectangle from the center and checks to see if there are any
    new holes in the region each time it expands.
