    Parameters
    ----------
    calibs : list of array_like
        List of calibration regions.

    Notes
    -----
    A generalized implementation of the method described in [1]_.
    Multiple ACS regions can be supplied to function.  GRAPPA is run
    for each ACS region and then averaged to produce the final
    reconstruction.
