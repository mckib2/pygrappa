'''Python implementation of the GRAPPA operator formalism.'''

import numpy as np


def grappaop(calib, coil_axis=-1, lamda=0.01):
    '''GRAPPA operator for Cartesian calibration datasets.

    Parameters
    ----------
    calib : array_like
        Calibration region data.  Usually a small portion from the
        center of kspace.
    coil_axis : int, optional
        Dimension holding coil data.
    lamda : float, optional
        Tikhonov regularization parameter.  Set to 0 for no
        regularization.

    Returns
    -------
    Gx, Gy : array_like
        GRAPPA operators for both the x and y directions.

    Notes
    -----
    Produces the unit operator described in [1]_.

    This seems to only work well when coil sensitivities are very
    well separated/distinct.  If coil sensitivities are similar,
    operators perform poorly.
