'''Demonstrate how to grid non-Cartesian data.

Notes
-----
In general, you should probably be using a fast NUFFT implementation,
such as that in BART or NFFT [1]_ [2]_.  Unfortunately, most of these
implementations do not work "out-of-the-box" with Python (i.e., can't
pip install them) and/or they aren't cross-platform solutions (e.g.,
BART doesn't officially support Microsoft Windows).  In the case of
BART, I find the Python interface to be rather clumsy. Those that you
can install through pip, e.g., pynufft, would be great alternatives,
but since this package isn't meant to be a showcase of fast NDFTs,
we're just going to use some simple interpolation methods provided by
scipy.  We just want to get a taste of what non-Cartesian datasets
look like.
