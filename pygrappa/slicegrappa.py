def slicegrappa(

        time_axis=-1, slice_axis=-1, lamda=0.01, split=False):
    '''(Split)-Slice-GRAPPA for SMS reconstruction.

    Parameters
    ----------
    kspace : array_like
        Time frames of sum of k-space coil measurements for
        multiple slices.
    calib : array_like
        Single slice measurements for each slice present in kspace.
        Should be the same dimensions.
    kernel_size : tuple, optional
        Size of the GRAPPA kernel: (kx, ky).
    prior : { 'sim', 'kspace' }, optional
        How to construct GRAPPA sources.  GRAPPA weights are found by
        solving the least squares problem T = S W, where T are the
        targets (calib), S are the sources, and W are the weights.
        The possible options are:

            - 'sim': simulate SMS acquisition from calibration data,
              i.e., sources S = sum(calib, axis=slice_axis).  This
              presupposes that the spatial locations of the slices in
              the calibration data are the same as in the overlapped
              kspace data.  This is similar to how the k-t BLAST
              Wiener filter is constructed (see equation 1 in [2]_).
            - 'kspace': uses the first time frame of the overlapped
              data as sources, i.e., S = kspace[1st time frame].

        This option is not used for Split-Slice-GRAPPA.

    coil_axis : int, optional
        Dimension that holds the coil data.
    time_axis : int, optional
        Dimension of kspace that holds the time data.
    slice_axis : int, optional
        Dimension of calib that holds the slice information.
    lamda : float, optional
        Tikhonov regularization for the kernel calibration.
    split : bool, optional
        Uses Split-Slice-GRAPPA kernel training method.

    Returns
    -------
    res : array_like
        Reconstructed slices for each time frame.  res will always
        return the data in fixed order or shape:
        (nx, ny, num_coils, num_time_frames, num_slices).

    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        When "prior" is an invalid option.

    Notes
    -----
    This function implements both the Slice-GRAPPA algorithm as
    described in [1]_ and the Split-Slice-GRAPPA algorithm as first
    described in [3]_.
